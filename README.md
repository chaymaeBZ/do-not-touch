# do-not-touch

This a ruby version of the game "don't touch the spikes"

I had the idea to develop this game after being separated from my lovely ruby a couple weeks. 
A weekend I kept saying "do not touch my ruby, do not touch my love for my ruby!".

This repo, this code is filled with love, desire and longing ... <3 

~ happy gaming
